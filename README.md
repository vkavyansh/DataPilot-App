# DataPilot-App
A lightweight Streamlit web application to quickly upload, clean, visualize, and generate automated reports from your datasets.

DataPilot is an interactive, Python-based data analytics tool built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload raw datasets (CSV/Excel) and seamlessly perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) without writing any code.

Key Features:

Upload & Clean: Instantly drop duplicates and impute missing values (Mean/Median/Zero) with a live data preview.

Custom Visualizations: Build tailored charts (Histograms, Bar, Pie, Scatter, etc.) using Matplotlib.

Executive Dashboard: Automatically generates a Power BI-style grid report with statistical summaries and KPIs.

Note: This is Version 1 of this project.
